## Evocations

Attunement of a Solar captain to the _Fall of the Sea_ awakens the hunger of the tortured souls used to forge its soulsteel hull. Stripped of their upper souls, the unfortunate ghosts are left only with their basest instincts, and lust eternally for wealth and blood. In the presence of nearby prey or mortal danger, their collective anguish and desire drives their screams to a fevered pitch, one loud enough to produce a strong echo in the mortal world and gather Essence behind the _Fall of the Sea_'s many large sails. The Essence provides a +4 boost to the _Fall of the Sea_'s speed while engaged in Pursuit or Escape actions (but only during these times).

_More evocations pending._

## Background

Forged at the end of the First Age, the _Fall of the Sea_ was an admission of defeat. Two-Faced Storm Daimyo, one of the last Solars to fall in the Usurpation, commissioned the ship even as he saw the Dragon-Blooded host overrun the Blessed Isle and encroach on his Western sanctum. By that time, it was abundantly clear that the rule of the Solar Exalted had ended. Resigned to the loss of his station as one of the Creation's great lords, Daimyo still had no intention of going quietly into his destiny. As the Dragon-Bloods approached, Daimyo slew his entire kingdom and used their hungry souls to forge a grand soulsteel hull. As the Dragon-Bloods drew even closer, he smelted his precious artifact collection, a panoply of orichalum weapons and jewelry accrued over several lifetimes, and used it to forge a grand representation of what he was to become: A kraken, a legendary monster of the sea. The orichalum kraken was affixed the ship's prow, a gruesome, indestructible battering ram. By the time Dragon-Blooded soldiers stormed the beaches of his archipelago, Daimyo, fleeing just in time aboard his now-complete ship, had laid waste to the entire kingdom, leaving them only with scorched sands and hungry ghosts. 

For centuries after, the _Fall of the Sea_ became a dreaded pirate vessel, emerging from storms and shadows to claim Shogunate vessels and drag them back into the darkness from whence it came. Daimyo amassed a large fleet of scavenged vessels and became a serious threat to the Shogunate navy. Eventually, the Shogunate responded with overwhelming force and destroyed most of the ships, but Daimyo fled aboard the _Fall of the Sea_. Although the Shogunate vessels gave chase, the _Fall of the Sea_ eventually disappeared entirely, seemingly vanishing without a trace. Many centuries passed before it was seen again.

In the Time of Tumult, Balthier "Triumphant Tides" Thorne, newly Exalted and sailing a crippled, stolen Lintha vessel with a paltry skeleton crew, encountered the misfortune of a completely calm day and too few oarsmen to move the vessel. Stranded on a sea of glass, Balthier spotted a ship in the distance and came to find it eerily abandoned. When Balthier boarded it, the ship seemed to come alive in a way that no man could describe, but any sailor could feel. _((Note: There is probably more to this story, but that's how Balthier tells it.))_

## Appearance

The _Fall of the Sea_ is a relatively large vessel, slightly larger than the blue-water merchant vessels favored by many pirates in the Time of Tumult. It is not subtle, a gleaming black hulk with twice the sails (cut from an equally striking black material) of a ship its size. A blood-red kraken is stiched into the main sail. The ship's most dramatic feature is a spectacular kraken sculpture that adorns the ship's prow, serving as both a ram and an unmistakble harbinger of the ship's approach. When the kraken ram is in direct sunlight, it shines a blinding gold, revealing that it is fashioned from solid orichalum.
